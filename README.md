# Firebase Studio

**IMPORTANT: This app is configured to use Firebase project `qonnect-f4852`.** This is set in the `.firebaserc` file and ensures all deployments target the correct project.

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Deployment Information

This project is configured for deployment using **classic Firebase Hosting**. This means that when you deploy, the contents of the `out` directory (generated by `npm run build`) are what will be visible on your live site.

### Manual Deployment (Troubleshooting)

If you need to deploy from your local machine, use the following commands from your terminal.

#### **Step 0: Finding the Right Folder (IMPORTANT!)**

If you see an error like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '...\\package.json'`, it means your terminal is in the wrong folder. When you download and unzip your project, the files might be inside another folder.

1.  **Navigate to your main project folder.** For example:
    ```bash
    cd C:\qonnect-web-app
    ```
2.  **List the contents of the folder** to see where the project files *really* are.
    ```bash
    dir
    ```
3.  Look for the folder that contains `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, etc. It might be named `qonnect-web-app` again, or `main`, or something similar.
4.  **Navigate into that inner folder.** For example, if you see a folder named `my-project-files`, run:
    ```bash
    cd my-project-files
    ```
    Once your terminal prompt shows you are in the correct sub-folder, you can proceed.

#### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Run this command once to download all the necessary code libraries.
```bash
npm install
```

#### **Step 2: Build Your Site**
This command compiles your Next.js application into a static `out` folder, ready for deployment.
```bash
npm run build
```

#### **Step 3: Deploy to Firebase**
Make sure you are logged into the Firebase CLI first (`firebase login`). Then, run:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Firebase Storage CORS Configuration
If you encounter storage errors (like `storage/unknown` or permissions errors when uploading files), your Firebase Storage bucket requires a one-time CORS configuration.

The most direct way is to use the `gsutil` command-line tool (which is part of the Google Cloud CLI). Make sure you are logged into the gcloud CLI and have selected the correct project. Then, run the following command from your project directory in the terminal:
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://qonnect-f4852.appspot.com
```
**Note:** The bucket name for new projects often uses `.appspot.com`. Please verify your exact bucket name in the Firebase Storage console by clicking on the 'Files' tab.

This command uses the `cors.json` file in this project to apply the necessary permissions, allowing uploads from the web app.
